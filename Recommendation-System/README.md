  <li>Section A: Simple Recommendation System using python</li>
  <li>Section B: Recommendation System using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)</li>
  <li>Section C: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model</li>
</ul>

## Section 1: Simple Recommendation System using python

We will use Python and pandas to create simple recommendation systems.

We will concentrate on offering a simple recommendation system in this notebook by recommending items that are most comparable to a given item.
Then, we can obtain correlations between two Pandas series using the corrwith() method. The most similar films should be obtained if the dataframe is sorted by correlation.

## Section 2: Recommendation System using KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)

Code: Product Recommender System

## Section 3: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation model

However, this suggestion is predicated on collaborative filtering, which makes use of readily gathered user behavior data. A matrix is used to represent the rating data, with products in the columns and users in the rows.

    - Item-Item Filtering
  - Model based collaborative filtering
    - Single Value Decomposition(SVD)
